# Work Resignation Analysis
This was a project done in collaboration with my groupmates, as part of the NUS Business Analytics Consulting Team. Our task was to conduct a regression analysis on a topic of our choice. We decided to practice constructing a supervised learning model by conducting logistic regression on resignation rates, taking into consideration factors such as satisfaction level, average monthly working hours and salary.

Based on our results, the accuracy of our logistic regression classifier on the test set was 0.7871, with the following confusion matrix:
